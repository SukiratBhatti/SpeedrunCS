# Project:
- AI, voice-based OS like in the movie "Her"

# PREREQUISITES:

- assembly
- CS from notation to DSA
- emulators and virtualizers / toolchain
- operating systems

# VISION:

- instead of keystrokes / mouseclicks, use the soundcard to capture audio commands by the user
- I haven't interacted with the OS, so this is a naive vision could pivot.
- possible pivot: voice controlled systems

# PHILOSOPHY:

- instead of foucsing on an idea, we can pivot quickly until we land on an idea that users want.
