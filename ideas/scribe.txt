# NAME: Cicero (cursor for writing)

# PROBLEM:
- sometimes, the right idea is in our minds, but it doesn't come out nicely on paper. How can AI improve rhetoric for us?

- 'Cicero' helps you write in any tone you want.
- The user highlights the text they want re-written, and prompts the AI, which creates a new sentence for the user to paste.
- prompt example: 're-write this sentence like Jay Z.' 

# USE CASES:
- where is rhetoric needed? Technical writing, public speaking, negotiations, etc.
- personally, when I write, I just want to get my ideas down on paper first. If an AI can go back and improve the rhetoric, that would save me time.

# REQUIREMENTS:
- Chrome extension that can be used on Google Docs, Email, or any other website.
- API key from frontier model (+ customizable temperature from user's end)

# SUCCESS METRIC:
- users are not re-typing after AI creates a sentence for them. Ie. no new keystrokes recorded.

# ARCHITECTURE:
- client: chrome extension
- API gateway
- model (custom prompt, disallowed content, caching)
- backend ()

# DATA MODEL:
- cloud history to store selected texts + rewrites (encrypted?)
